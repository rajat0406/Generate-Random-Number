This project is good to start with Android Development
This project consists of basic concepts used to start with Android:
# 1. Intent:
An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component. Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases:

  # Starting an activity
  An Activity represents a single screen in an app. You can start a new instance of an Activity by passing an Intent to startActivity().     The Intent describes the activity to start and carries any necessary data.

  If you want to receive a result from the activity when it finishes, call startActivityForResult(). Your activity receives the result as   a separate Intent object in your activity's onActivityResult() callback. For more information, see the Activities guide.

  # Starting a service
  A Service is a component that performs operations in the background without a user interface. With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later,   you can start a service with JobScheduler. For more information about JobScheduler, see its API-reference documentation.



  # Delivering a broadcast
  A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. The system delivers various broadcasts for system events, such as when the system       boots up or the device starts charging. You can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an Intent to sendBroadcast() or    sendOrderedBroadcast().
